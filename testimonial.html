The result of his work at Canterbury was a cogent, analytical piece of research, which is now a strong addition to the literature in this field. While working toward his PhD degree, Semiu has also published several articles and book chapters. This was an impressive level of output for someone at this stage of development. He has always been a dedicated academic scholar. I have seen his previous research questions turn to new ones and I have witnessed his appetite for research continues to grow.<br> As a teacher, Semiu was very adept at Canterbury. I knew he already had teaching experience but I was impressed with his interpersonal skills and his ability to connect with our undergraduate students. He ran two of the tutorial sessions for our large introductory class and was adept at handling the many issues that arose during any semester. Semiu’s skills are extensive. He is extremely organized and an efficient worker. He is entirely self-motivated with high personal standards. He is a creative, intelligent, goal-oriented person and has proven himself to be a strong teacher. He works well with others and is eager to contribute<i class="fas fa-quote-right ml-3"></i>

He has his eyes fixed on the stars though his slogan “the sky is the beginning”. With the vision tagged: “Boldstep to Prof.”, Dr Bello draws the blueprint of his academic sojourn right from childhood and pursued it with great zeal.
						<br>
					  As a colleague, I can attest to the research prowess of Dr Bello as his research articles numbering over 45 have been published in local and international journals. He is grounded in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. He is well noted for his painstaking efforts in turning up quality research article at given deadline.
					  <br>
					  I am one of the beneficiaries of his mentorship efforts which he conducted with passion.
					  <br>
					  Everywhere he goes, he mentors budding and senior researchers and just like numerous people in and outside Nigeria, my success story will not be complete without a mention of his tutelage to make me what I am today even when I was completely hopeless back then. 
					  <br>
					  Dr Bello has this “monitoring spirit”, pursuing you with vigour and adopting alluring techniques for you to aim for the stars just as he has done to himself. The manifestation of this is evidence in the success of my academic session.
					  <br>
					  The scholar lives by example who sacrifices his time, energy and resources to add value to other people’s live. He has this magical touch on lives of people who are around him. He benefits his friends and return bad deeds with good ones. He is loved by his foes and it has become a tradition for people to cry when he is taking up new challenges and had to say good bye in any organisation or institution he had found himself in the past. 
					  <br>
					  If an organisation is at its low, the turnaround will definitely be witnessed with the coming on board of Dr Bello. If an organisation seems to be at its optimum, when Dr Bello joins, it will almost get to a stage of utopia. In all higher institutions, groups and organisation he was engaged in the past, his name is written in gold.
					  <br>
					   While I look forward to seeing more of his intervention in the area of his expertise “Health Communication”,
					  Dr Bello to me is an angel in the body of man. I mean every bit of statement I made here.<i class="fas fa-quote-right ml-3"></i>

					  <i class="fas fa-quote-left mr-3"></i>   I have established and enjoyed association with Dr. Bello Semiu for over 15 years. He was first my student at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Nigeria but due to his impeccable academic excellence and diligence, we later became colleagues at the same university. 
						<br>
					  We further both were co-PhD candidates at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Dr. Semiu is a matured, diligent man with a research ability of over 40 publications in academic journals both nationally and internationally. 
					  <br>
					  He is also a kind-hearted person, supportive and a natural mentor for others. A testimony of this was his influence in encouraging and supporting 3 other colleagues to pursue their Doctorate Degree alongside himself at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. 
					  <br>
					  He is an experienced teacher, a seasoned researcher and well-travelled. He is also a dedicated father and husband.
					  <br>
					  Kindly accord him all necessary support and engagement.
